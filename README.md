# Quotes

A simple, self-hosted quotes website built with Go, HTMX, and Tailwind.

## About

My friend [Guney](https://github.com/gcg) started collecting quotes in 2006 during our IRC discussions on Freenode (#kanal and #turklug).

When he decided to shut down his quotes site, he backed up the entire database and gave it to me in 2015.

Iâ€™ve been storing that database ever since. It contains valuable memories from friends from nearly twenty years ago.

I thought it would be a shame to let it go to waste, so I decided to create a simple website to host the quotes.

Of course, I'm not sharing the entire database content, but I thought it would be nice to have a simple website to browse the quotes.

## Features

- Browse **latest**, **top**, and **random** quotes
- Add new quotes via a simple form
- Upvote or downvote existing quotes
- Responsive UI with Tailwind and dynamic interactions powered by HTMX

## Usage

Update configuration (port, DB connection) in `.env` (`.env.example` is provided as a template).

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   > Note: The database should be created and seeded with the `quotes.sql` file.

Run the server:

   ```shell
   go build
   ./quotes
   ```
Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## To launch with Docker Compose:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
